I love quizzes!

When I was younger, I could spend hours reading magazines and, inevitably, I took a lot of quizzes.

**"What's your theme song?"** ("Walking on Sunshine", which still gets stuck in my head randomly.)

**"Are you more Type A or Type B?"** (More Type A...I'm a perfectionist, and it's a struggle sometimes.)

**"How much do you really know about fashion?"** (Turns out...not much.)

Now that I've grown up a bit, I still find myself drawn to quizzes, many of which are related to my career. And that's what led me to research how quizzes could help me to generate business.

Quizzes are great for getting people to interact with your site and learn more about your brand or the services you offer. I highly recommend you try placing one on your website!

But writing one can be difficult. How do you decide what the topic of your quiz should even be?

I struggled for a bit when I wrote [my quiz](https://www.tryinteract.com/share/quiz/5b61e04af8ef7b0014a473ca), so today I'm sharing some tips, examples, and 30 quiz ideas for designers. I hope these help to provide inspiration for creating your very own quiz!

## Tips for Writing a Quiz

First things first, let's talk about how to go about writing a quiz.

1. **Find a topic idea.** Think about your target audience. What do they most want to know about? What content brings people to your website already? What questions do you already use to qualify your leads?
2. **Start with the results first.** What outcomes do you want to lead your readers to?
3. **Write 5-10 quiz questions.** You want to keep your quiz short enough to hold your reader's interest. Use this [Quiz Content Worksheet](http://help.tryinteract.com/getting-started/quiz-content-worksheet) provided by Interact to stay organized.
4. **Find interesting and relevant photos.** The best quizzes involve stimulating visuals to go with your words.
5. **Build your quiz!** Choose a quiz platform that works for you. I chose to use [Interact](https://www.tryinteract.com#oid=94736_4020) (affiliate link) several months ago after seeing the brand pop up on a couple of quizzes that I enjoyed taking. I've had a great experience and will be sticking with their service.
6. **Connect your quiz results to your newsletter.** Get interested readers onto your newsletter and offer them more valuable content made especially for them.
7. **Embed your quiz onto your website.** You can embed your quiz directly on your website to help keep your readers on your site longer. Let people know you have a quiz! Don't hide it. Encourage people to try it out.
8. **Fine tune your quiz over time.** If the quiz platform you choose to use has analytics (Interact does), use those statistics to find confusing questions or unexpected results. Make your quiz better as you get more results.
