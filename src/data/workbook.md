title: "Ultimate Homepage Workbook"
---

A free 13-page workbook to help you create content for your homepage. Use it to redesign your homepage or use it as inspiration to create content workbooks for your design clients.

<hr>

A website homepage serves as a first introduction to a business. But it can be difficult to collect and write welcoming and clear content.

To make creating content less stressful, I created this workbook. You'll find specific questions to help you craft engaging and effective content.

## For Designers
Getting clients to deliver content on time is one of the hardest parts of the web design process. Use this template as inspiration to create your own workbooks and feel free to copy the words directly as needed.

Every designer's process is different, but this template can help give you an idea of what to provide clients to encourage them to do the work.
