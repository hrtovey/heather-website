          products are subject to change.
        </p>
        <h2>Commercial License</h2>
        <p>
          The Commercial License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing,
          non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the digital work you
          have purchased. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of
          title.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may use a single digital work multiple times within one website.
          However, that digital work may not be used on multiple websites unless
          repurchased per each additional website or if repurchased as a
          Developer License.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from
          the materials or digital work provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot redistribute the digital work as stock, in a tool or
          template, or with source files. You cannot do this with a digital work
          either on its own or bundled with other items, and even if you modify
          the digital work. You cannot redistribute or make available the
          digital work “as is” or with superficial modifications. These things
          are not allowed even if the redistribution is for free.
        </p>
        <p>
          This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these
          restrictions and may be terminated by me at any time. Upon terminating
          your license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your
          possession whether in electronic or printed format.
        </p>
        <h2>Developer License</h2>
        <p>
          The Developer License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing,

          have purchased. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of
          title.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may use a single digital work multiple times on as many websites
          for you or your client(s) for as long as you wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from
          the materials or digital work provided.
