                <p>Hello and welcome!</p>
                <p>My name is Heather Tovey, and I create all of the content and resources here at heathertovey.com. I'm a self-taught developer (with thanks to the many resources that other developers have created), and I love teaching and sharing resources. I'm currently a Front-End Developer at <a href="https://www.iamota.com/" target="_blank">iamota</a>, a Shopify Plus Design &amp; Development agency.</p>

                <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
                <p>I didn't start out in the field of technology. It wasn't something I realized I could even do. Had it been on my radar, I may have chosen a career path in computer science. But I didn't own a computer or have reliable internet access until I was already enrolled in university.</p>
                <p>Instead, I earned my BA in Psychology at Agnes Scott College (which has given me a useful perspective on user experience). Even then, I tended to gravitate toward online communities. I distinctly remember learning just enough CSS in order to style my LiveJournal blog.</p>
                <p>I pursued a career in Psychology after I graduated and I even briefly attended a PhD program. But on the side, I kept exploring the world of web development.</p>
                <div>
                    <g-image style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="~/assets/images/heather_mentorship.jpg" />
                </div>
                <p>At the time, I thought I was too old (as if there is such a thing) and too far behind to get into web dev. But luckily, with encouragement from friends and family, I decided to pursue it for real.</p>
                <p>I joined the local Ladies Learning Code community, and started actively learning. I realized that there are a lot of people learning to code and changing careers every day. So about 10 years ago, I transitioned into a career of web development.</p>
                <p>Since then, I've freelanced remotely for several years. I've worked with designers and agencies around the world to bring custom coding and development know-how to their projects.</p>
                <p>I started giving back to the community by mentoring and leading workshops for Canada Learning Code. I've taught and written curriculum for the Fast Track web dev bootcamp at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology(SAIT). And now, I'm working at a wonderful agency that specializes in Shopify Plus for enterprise merchants.</p>
