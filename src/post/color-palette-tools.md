Color is important.

Color conveys emotions (urgency, calm, fun). It provides your readers with additional information (warnings vs disabled buttons). Color sets the tone of your website and guides your readers to where you want or need them to go.

If you're designing your brand or website, choosing a color palette is one of the first things you'll do.

But with so many colors to choose from, how do you decide which ones to use?

Here are some of my favorite color palette generators and color tools to help you design your brand and website.


## Color Inspiration

These tools are so helpful for generating color palettes and seeing them in use. I often use these tools first to get an idea of what colors would work best and then hone from there.

Want to see beautiful artwork and illustrations that incorporate a particular color? Turn to Dribbble's color tool. Search for the color you want to see and Dribbble will provide you with a number of illustrations and projects that use that color. This is great for seeing if the color looks good in the wild or for finding more colors to add to your color palette.

Pinterest is so useful for collecting and organizing colors, images, and textures that you love. Here, you can find plenty of curated color palettes. Here's my [Color Palettes](https://www.pinterest.ca/heather_tovey/color-palettes/) board to get you started.

## Accessibility and Color Contrast

While creating your color palette, keep in mind that not everyone sees color the same way. People have different vision limitations and these can affect the way your favorite colors look to them. Use these tools to help you create a color palette that doesn't leave anyone out.

![ WebAIM homepage allows you to immediately check for color contrast. ](./images/WebAIM.png)

[WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

A color contrast checker that will show you if your text passes [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (WCAG) at different standards. This tool is especially useful if you're new to WCAG because it tells you what it's testing for.

![ Contrast Ratio color page has instructions on the main page as well as a place to input color choices. ](./images/ContrastRatio.png)

[Contrast Ratio](http://contrast-ratio.com) by Lea Verou

I personally love using this handy little tool put together by Lea Verou. Simply add your background color and your text color to see if your contrast ratio passes standards. If not, you can use the up and down keyboard arrows to change the colors and try to get closer to passing standards.

![ Use sliders to change color contrast on Colorable's homepage. ](./images/Colorable.png)

[Colorable](https://colorable.jxnblk.com/006655/9900ff)

Another useful way to test color contrast. Use sliders to change the Hue, Saturation, and Lightness of the different colors until your colors pass color contrast standards.

![ NoCoffee opens up to give you access to over 20 different ways to change your website to reflect vision differences. ](./images/NoCoffee.png)

[NoCoffee](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nocoffee/jjeeggmbnhckmgdhmgdckeigabjfbddl/)

A Chrome browser extention that allows you to test websites and color palettes by showing you what those web pages look like for someone with slight or extreme vision problems. This tool tests how websites look with Low Acuity, Low Contrast Sensitivity, Colorblindness, Visual snow, glare, ghosting, and cataracts, Nystagmus, and Obstructed visual field. This will give you a good step toward making your website usable and visible for more people.

## Color Games

If you're having fun, it doesn't feel like learning right? These games may not be helpful for everyday color palette design, but they can help you level up your color skills!

![ 4 challenges of sorting by hue. Instructions are provided as well as facts about how different people see colors. ](./images/X-rite.png)

[The X-Rite Color Challenge](https://www.xrite.com/hue-test)

Complete a quick hue sorting challenge to see if you have a color vision deficiency. This challenge doesn't replace a full exam, but it's fun to sort the colors and it may just turn up an issue you weren't aware of.

![ 3 little alien bug creatures of different colors float down the screen closer to your city. You must defend the city with a cannon. Shoot the Invader that matches the color given to you in hex format. ](./images/Hex-invaders.png)

[Hex Invaders](http://www.hexinvaders.com/)

Want a fun way to practice your hexadecimal color knowledge? Play this game and shoot the hex invader whose color matches the hex code provided to you. Useful? Maybe not. Fun? YES!

Okay, I can't pretend that I have any use for this game. You simply click on the lighter color of 2 colors as quickly as you can. The game ends when you click on a darker color. The more light colors you click on, the higher your score. Waste time with color!
