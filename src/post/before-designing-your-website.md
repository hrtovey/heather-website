Why do you want a website?

That's an an important question you need to ask before designing your website.

If you don't ask the right questions before starting the design process, you could be left with a website that is **useless**. Or worse, a website that **turns away** your best potential clients.

Do yourself a favor and take the time to think about your target audience and your website's goals before designing your website.

To help you do that, I've created an exhaustive list of questions that will cover:

- who you're marketing to
- what kind of website you need
- how to design the best website to meet your business goals.

It's likely that you already know the answer to many of these questions. Take a minute to write down the answers so that you can better communicate your website goals and needs with others.

Whether you choose to DIY your website or work with a designer, be sure to go over these questions **before** you start the design process.
