Have you seen those articles across the web with 1000+ free tools to get you started? I don't know about you, but those lists can be a little overwhelming. 

In my coding journey, I often found myself falling into this pattern:

1. "Okay, I'd like to code, but where do I start?"
2. Find a useful article with 100+ resources to learn to code for free.
3. Read through the list and open interesting links in a new tab.
4. Go through my 50+ open tabs to see if the resource seem actually useful.

Before I know it, an hour or two had passed and I've come away with a few links and no actual progress.

Sooooo not efficient.

If you've found yourself falling into the same trap, well...this article is for you.

I've created a curated short list of resources that I recommend you use to learn Front-End Development. These resources are specifically for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and include some project ideas and other helpful tips and advice to help get you started.

## A Note About These Resources
When you're just starting out, I fully believe that you should focus on using free resources. You're already expending a lot of your time on learning something new, so you shouldn't spend your money unless it's absolutely what you need.

Free resources allow you to try your hand at different things to see if you actually like them. If you're just starting your coding journey, it may take you a while to find something that really clicks for you. Free resources are a great guilt-free way to explore what's out there!

So what that means is that the resources on this list are all free. Keep in mind, though, that you may want to invest your money in some quality courses on specific topics down the road. Until then, soak up all the free resources and figure out where you might want to spend a little money to get focused training.

## Useful Resources

### FreeCodeCamp

This is an incredible community with a project-based curriculum for learning web development. Start out by earning your certificate in Responsive Web Design and go from there.

This is the resource I most often recommend first. It has an excellent curriculum and a wonderful community. And it will give you a solid roadmap to help you learn efficiently.

If you find that you prefer more structured in-class learning (like a bootcamp or certificate program), this will still give you a great head start.

### Frontend Masters

Alternatively, or even in combination with, you could check out the free Web Development bootcamp hosted at Frontend Masters. This is a 21 hour project-based course covering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### CodeAnalogies

I used to teach a web dev bootcamp at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. One of the resources that really helped my students to grasp the harder material was CodeAnalogies. 

This is a website dedicated to breaking down difficult web development concepts through the use of memorable analogies and imagery. 

For instance, one of the articles is titled CSS Positioning Explained By Building An Ice Cream Sundae. That's a pretty neat way to learn about CSS! (And also, it makes me want ice cream.)

If you feel stuck at some point or feel like you just need a little help to make something click for you, check to see if they cover the concept on this website!

## Projects

Projects are the best way to learn.

Not tutorials where you follow along to make something. Not courses where the curriculum is very guided and keeps you on training wheels.

Projects. Your own projects using your own ideas.

You will get stuck and it will feel hard. We have all been there. But pushing through to a breakthrough is when you truly learn something that will stay with you.

Having said that, coming up with ideas for projects can be incredibly difficult. You want a project that is challenging enough so that you're learning, but not so difficult that give up and walk away. You want projects that could be good portfolio pieces too.

So here a few ideas to get you started. Choose something that you're excited about!

### JavaScript 30

Wes Bos takes you through building 30 things in 30 days with 30 tutorials. 

This can be a super fun way to practice JavaScript and come out with some projects on your portfolio. 

With that said, the videos themselves walk you through how to create the project. So to get the most use out of this, I'd recommend trying your hand at the project before watching the video, just to see how far you can get on your own.

Another thing you can do is to go back after you've watched the videos, choose a few projects that you liked the most, and add on to them. If you put these types of projects in your portfolio, you should take some time to customize them first. 

What features will you add? What design tweaks will you make? How will you make it a better experience?

### Your Personal Site

Even if you go for a super minimalist site with a basic About section and your contact info, try to make it fun. 

Check out some other portfolios and personal sites, or look on Dribbble and find things that interest you. You can build and change your site over time to learn new things as you go.

### Create an Email Template

One incredibly valuable skill is creating email templates. And you can do this with HTML and CSS alone!

Email templates often use ```tables``` for structure instead of the more modern techniques we have at our disposal. So if you go down this road, prepare to either love it or hate it.

If you're feeling adventurous, this could be a really great portfolio piece to showcase your HTML and CSS skills. And from what I've seen, there are always designers looking to hire someone who specialize in developing email templates.

Here's a tutorial to get you started: [https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/build-an-html-email-template-from-scratch--webdesign-12770](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/build-an-html-email-template-from-scratch--webdesign-12770)

### Create a Day/Night Toggle

You've probably seen day/night toggles around the web. This website has one, for example. 

A day/night toggle is a button that allows your visitors to swap the color theme on your site. This is great for reading at night and some people just prefer the color scheme all together. 

If you want to make it more advanced, learn about the [prefers-color-scheme media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) to automatically turn on dark mode for your user if they prefer it. Sidenote: you should still give them the ability to toggle it on and off.

You can go another step further and use JavaScript to store this information in localStorage so that your site will remember their preference when they visit again.

## Hosting Your Projects

While you can build websites locally (directly on your computer), you're going to eventually want to host them. Here are some of the resources I've used and love for free website hosting.

### Netlify

This is what my site is currently hosted on and I love it! 

To use Netlify, you'll want to host your code using version control (GitHub is a solid choice and a lot of tutorials use it). Then, you can follow a few steps to hook up your GitHub repository to your Netlify site. Soon, your new website will be ready to share with everyone. 

Here's a [step-by-step guide on deploying on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/) to help you.

Other alternatives: Zeit, Vercel

### GitHub Pages

GitHub pages is a great alternative to Netlify and means you can do everything from GitHub itself. [GitHub Pages has far fewer features than Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/), but it is really great for starting out. 

If you don't need more advanced features, then GitHub pages may be perfect for you. The important thing is actually launching your projects, and GitHub Pages is built-in to the GitHub code repositories you may already be using.

Other alternatives: GitLab Pages

## Next Steps

Once you feel comfortable with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you'll have a better understanding of what you like and don't like. 

From here, you can take some time to think about your goals and the type of projects you most enjoy. If you're interested in getting a job in web development, take a look at different job ads and create a list of topics you can practice.

For example, you can definitely get a job as a developer with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge, but if all the jobs you're interested in require React, then you know that's something you should spend some time learning.

If you're interested in running your own business, then you'll want to spend some time learning about marketing and invoicing in addition to any specific skills you want to offer as part of your services.

If you're not sure yet what your goals are or you want to keep practicing your skills while you're figuring things out, here are some suggestions.

If you're a fan of CSS, spend some time learning about CSS animations to add fun and delightful experiences to the web. If you're a fan of JavaScript, think about learning something like React to help you create fun web apps.

Some other topics you may want to study include:

- accessibility
- web performance
- user experience

There's a lot to learn, but I promise you that we are all learning constantly. It can feel overwhelming when you're first starting out, but just know that you're not behind. The world of web development changes frequently, and it can feel like you'll never catch up. But the upside of these frequent changes is that you can become an expert in new technology and practices in a much shorter period of time than you might think.

## 

I highly recommend following 1 resource until the end (I've listed a couple of them below). Once you complete it, you'll have a better idea of where your strengths and weaknesses are, and you'll be able to focus on finding more intermediate/advanced resources that can help you to round out your weaknesses.

Skipping around to different resources will mean learning the same foundational material over and over again. This will be much slower and also demotivating. You want to keep yourself interested in the material.

Another benefit of following this path is to make sure you're really interested in the topic. If you're not, you'll be able to try out a different type of coding knowing that you gave Front-End development a real shot. You may also find that self-directed learning isn't for you. If this is the case, you'll already have a leg up for any bootcamps or courses you take in the future.
